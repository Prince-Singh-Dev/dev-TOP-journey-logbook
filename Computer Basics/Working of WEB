QUES 1 - How does the Internet Work ?


The Internet is the backbone of the Web, the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together.

It was began in 1960s by the US army funds for the research project then it was furthur evolved and come in use for public in 1980s by the collaboration of some public sector and Private companies 


** A simple network **


When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (for example with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth systems). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.

but this can be complex due to multiple connections .. So to solve this issue , each computer is connected to a switch known as network switch whose working is same like railway signaler , whose complete work is to take care that one message transfer from one computer A should reach to the only computer B at which it was sent ..

but what if , we need 1000+ computer on the network then at that time we can connect multiple devices with the switch that is furthur connected to another switch with different number of connected devices but this solution leads to a problem that if one switch fails then plenty number of devices connected to that newtork will be disconnected ....

to solve this issue , we got router in our networking devices , whose work is to get the message in form of packets then router just reads the packets recieptent's addrress and sender's address and send the packet to the reciever directly without much travelling of packets from one place to another ...

The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.



Ques 2 - Finding a Computer (IP , DNS)



Basically , each computer that is connected to a network has a specific address known as IP (Internet Protocol) .. It's an address of four numbers seprated with dots : for example :- 192.6.2.272

but as humans it is harder for us to remember the IP so the IP is align with the human readable and rememberable name known as Domain name .. for example :- google.com is the domain name given over the IP 142.250.190.78 and it is easier to search google.com rather than searching with its IP


Ques 3 - Intenet and The WEB 


Internet is basically the Infrastructure created to connect millions of devices together whereas the WEB is built as service over that infrastructure ..

** Intranets and Extranets ** 

Intranet is basically the private networks whose access is very limited . for example :- An Organisation host a webpage to share resources with thier members then this type of network is known as Intranets ..

Whereas

Extranets are same as Intranet but it is open scource means not limited to few people , it is basically used to collaborate and share resources with other organisations as well ..


Ques 4 - Difference between Web Server , Web Page and Search Engine

WEBPAGE : A document that can be displayed in a web browser. These are also often called just "pages". Such documents are written in the HTML language (which we look at in more detail later on)...

WEBSITE : Collection of WebPages connected in group together into a single resource with the links connecting them together is known as Website ...

WEBSERVER : A computer that hosts the website on the internet ...

Search Engine : A web service that basically helps you to access the internet , websites and their webpages .. there are various types of Search Engines : Mozilla FireFox , Yahoo , Chrome , Microsoft Edge ...


Ques 5 - How different parts of web works and interact with each other

Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers.

Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome)

Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage code is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be rendered by the browser and displayed to the user.

In order for data to get back and forth, we need the following things:

1. Your internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the internet. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.

2. TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might travel along the road).

3. DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address — the actual address the server is located at — before it can retrieve the website.

4. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods. 

5. Files: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:

(i)  Code: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the different programming languages websites are written in, which the browser        interprets and assembles into a web page to display to a user.

(ii) Assets: This is a collective term for all the other items that appear on a website — such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs — that aren't code that the browser interprets.

So what happens, exactly?

When you type a web address (which is technically part of a URL) into your browser address bar, the following steps occur:

The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (you look up the address of the shop).

The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.

If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house).

The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you (you get the goods home — new shiny stuff, awesome!).

..... Some of the basic HTML Codes that every programer should know about .....

200 -- Ok Status
301 -- when the requested resource has moved to a new location 
400 -- Server can't response 
403 -- Server is not giving access to the requested client 
404 -- forbidden error / server can't find the requested resources
503 -- request can't be handled by server / might be server is offline or under maintainence


..... Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and its Components .....

for example : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

1. https --> The protocol being used to send the request. In this case, we are using HTTPS, which is a secure version of HTTP that stops bad people from reading your data while it is being transported

2. developer.mozilla.org --> official domain name 

3. /en-US/ --> The path to the resource on the server that you are accessing
